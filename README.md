- The code for training and testing the model is stored in `model_code_and_results.ipynb` (as well as in `model_code.py`).
- The output that was generated from running the code is stored in `model_code_and_results.ipynb` (as well as in `output.txt`).
- A confusion matrix was also created to evaluate the performance of the model on the test set, it is stored in `model_code_results.ipynb` (as well as in `confusion_matrix.png`).
- The model has been saved, and is stored at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1993KkTxeRQtMjozh7CKvrw33XcLcR3tG?usp=sharing
